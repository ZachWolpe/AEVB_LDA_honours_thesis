A challenge of modern data science is the diversity of the data: data types like text & images often translate to large, sparse numerical representations - which are often impractical for computation using traditional statistical techniques

My honour thesis we explored the viability of scaling Variational Bayes (VB) with a deep autoencoder (AEVB) to learn latent topic distributions (LDA)

We published the paper at the FAIR (Forum for Artificial Intelligence Research) conference & I presented my work in December 2019
